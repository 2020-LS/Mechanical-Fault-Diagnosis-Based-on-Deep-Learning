# Mechanical-Fault-Diagnosis-Based-on-Deep-Learning
CNN for mechanical fault diagnosis
These codes serve for in two papers: 'Rolling Element Bearings Fault Intelligent Diagnosis Based on Convolutional Neural Networks Using Raw Sensing Signal'(paper_1) and 
'Bearings Fault Diagnosis Based on Convolutional Neural Networks with 2-D Representation of Vibration Signals as Input'(paper_2). 
Prerequisite, Matlab 2013a, Python 2.7.11, Tesorflow(better in ubuntu14.04). 
To start with, you should run image_matrix.m to prepare your own data. 
second, disorder_images.py and input_bear_data.py should be used to tansform your data into the input format of tensorflow. 
last, you may choose to run mnist_b.py or mnist_c.py for paper_1 or mnist_2d.py for paper_2.
